PokeapiChallenge

In this application I used the MVVM architecture to come up with the solution. I create a single instance of the OKHHTP3 client to be able to get data from the api and return it. After that in the viewModel I  took the necessary field "base_experience" and passed that into a function where it calculated the cost of the pokemon given the parameters and returned that the value. After that I observed changes in the viewModel function to show the updated values. I made use of coroutines to run the tasks in the background instead of the mian thread. I made use of sharedPreferences to store the account balance. After searching for your pokemon It will show a prompt telling you if yuou have enough money to purchase the pokemon. The purchase button will be active if you have enough, and inactive if you do not have enough. If you have enough the purchase button is active and if you press that you are taken to the next screen where it will give you a summary of the purchase and button to confirm that purchase
